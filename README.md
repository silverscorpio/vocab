### Vocabulary Practice App

* desktop-based application for practicing words
* developed in Python using Tkinter for GUI
* came up with the idea as I was (still) learning Russian (still doing, my 4th language)
* has two main components - word list and app GUI
    * the word list reads the words from a file and thereafter cleans and parses the file for words and their meanings
      in a specific format (*word-meaning(s)*)
    * app GUI builds the desktop application and uses the word list to allow practice of the words
