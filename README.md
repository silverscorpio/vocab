## Vocabulary Practice App

* desktop-based application for practicing words
* developed in Python using Tkinter for GUI
* came up with the idea as I was learning Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º (an ongoing process)
* two main components - word list and app GUI
    * the word list reads the words from a file and thereafter cleans and parses the read data for words and their
      meanings in a specific format (*word-meaning(s)*) depending on the type of parsing needed
    * app GUI builds the desktop application and uses the word list to allow vocab practice
