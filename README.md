### Vocabulary Practice App

* Desktop-based application for practicing words through repetition
* developed in Python using Tkinter
* individual project developed entirely on my own as a need arose for having a way to consolidate vocab gathered from
  various resources
* came up with the idea when I was learning Russian (still doing, my 4th language)
* has two main components - word list and app GUI
    * the word list reads and parses the words and their meanings in a specific format (*word-meaning*)
    * app GUI builds the desktop application and uses the word list to allow practicing the words
